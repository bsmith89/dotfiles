My attempt at a dotfiles system.  Based loosely on
https://github.com/sontek/dotfiles and various projects listed on
http://dotfiles.github.io/

Stow configuration inspired by
<http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html>

Enjoy!

##Usage
Place dotfiles in home directory

	make install

Include platform specific files:

	make install PLATFORM=[osx/flux/etc.]

Restore original dotfiles in home directory

	make restore


##TODO
+ Vim
	+ Thesaurus
	+ Figure out path completion for several filetypes.
+ Git
	+ portable difflatex


## NOTES
