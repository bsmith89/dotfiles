My attempt at a dotfiles system.  Based loosely on
https://github.com/sontek/dotfiles and various projects listed on
http://dotfiles.github.io/

Enjoy!

After git clone github.com/bsmith89/dotfiles
Clone vundle: (a requirement)
	git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim

Usage:
	Place dotfiles in home directory
		make install
	
	Restore original dotfiles in home directory
		make restore


TODO:
maybe add https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate.git (figure out how to
turn it off for most filetypes)
Edit .vimrc to use solarized by default
