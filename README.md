My attempt at a dotfiles system.  Based loosely on
https://github.com/sontek/dotfiles and various projects listed on
http://dotfiles.github.io/

Enjoy!

##Usage
Place dotfiles in home directory

	make install

Include platform specific files:

	make install PLATFORM=[osx/flux/etc.]

Restore original dotfiles in home directory

	make restore


##TODO
+ Vim
	+ Thesaurus
	+ Figure out keybindings for YCM and Ultisnips
	+ Figure out path completion for several filetypes.
+ Git
	+ portable difflatex
